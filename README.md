TcmDebugger
===========

TcmDebugger is a .NET console application which runs the SDL Tridion Content Manager render/publishing engine in a local context.

This allows a developer to extensively debug .NET templates, .NET custom function sources and .NET custom mediators on their local machine. 

Details and download information can be found in the [TcmDebugger wiki](https://github.com/robvanoostenrijk/TcmDebugger/wiki).
